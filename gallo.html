		The rooster is an animal that represents strength and fight. Roosters are commonly used in the palenques of Mexico for the famous cockfights. This lottery image is chosen to be one of the first because the rooster is a symbol of a new awakening, it represents the first hour of the morning, where people know it is time to start working the land.
